# About my first project on GitHub : Breakout
In my first independent project during 8th grade, I developed a game inspired by one of my all-time favorites using Java. Choosing Java as the programming language was pivotal due to its versatility and robust object-oriented features, which greatly facilitated the game's development. Java's extensive libraries and frameworks, such as JavaFX for graphics and user interface design, enabled me to create detailed and dynamic visuals that enhanced the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, Java's platform independence allowed my game to run seamlessly on various operating systems, broadening its accessibility. Throughout the project, I deepened my understanding of Java's syntax and programming concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and event handling, which were essential in creating a smooth and interactive game. This project not only showcased Java's strengths but also solidified my passion for game development and provided a strong foundation for future projects.
